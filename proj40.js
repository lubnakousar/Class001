/**Album: Write a function called make_album() that builds a Object describing a music album.
 * The function should take in an artist name and an album title, and it should return a
 * Object containing these two pieces of information. Use the function to make three dictionaries representing
 * different albums. Print each return value to show that Objects are storing the album information correctly.
 * Add an optional parameter to make_album() that allows you to store the number of tracks on an album. If the calling line
 * includes a value for the number of tracks, add that value to the albumâ€™s Object. Make at least one new function call that includes
 * the number of tracks on an album. */
